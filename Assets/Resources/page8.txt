Charging the undead creature with sword in hand your epic clash begins.

Blows are shared but unfortunately you were still weakened from the fight with the goblin.

You were able to defeat the skeleton but not without great cost.

Succumbing to your wounds you fall to the ground and look to the sky wondering if you could have made a better choice.
